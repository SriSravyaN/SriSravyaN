###About me 
-->I am a proactive ,enthusiastic and curious girl 🌸
I always loved learning and understanding,exploring new things, new technologies .

The very first technology I was into is machine learning and
It has been a game changer to me!🌝

In this pandemic,my thirst for learning has taken a step forward and
I'm now familiar and experienced with DevOps,Hybrid Cloud computing,AndroidApp Development and Automation with Devops Ansible.

Along with the Curiousity I've for tech, I'm also a constructive critic,social,empowering and a team player with capability of wearing multi hats adds on a equal weightage.😇
